# ArtDroid
## WordPress for Artists
Built by Phong for Andrdoid Jones website.

Build with [Postworld](https://github.com/ansonphong/postworld), a WordPress theme development framework.

### Getting Started
Just clone this into `/wp-content/themes/artdroid` and you're good to go.

### Common gotchas
- After cloning, make sure to also go into `/artdroid` and run this command to download all the required submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Make sure permissions on `/wp-content/uploads` is `777`
- Make sure permissions on `/wp-content/themes/artdroid/postworld/deploy` are `777`
